          value="front-end-projects"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Conscious consumer 🛒 : Your money is your vote for a better world, and you vote often. You patronise sustainable and ethical designers, you are always contributing to cool Kickstarters, and you see nothing wrong with doing all your shopping at Whole Foods. You love a good one-for-one product. You don’t have time to DIY any of your products, but that’s OK, because someone else did it for you and has some cool branding to boot.<br></br></label

      <label>
        <input
          name="prefer"
          value="back-end-projects"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Local Foodie 🌽: You don’t go a week without visiting the farmer’s market and loading up. You have a stack of seasonal cookbooks up to your chest, and nothing gets you more excited than ramps in the spring. In fact, you look down on those who eat asparagus or berries out of season – those people just haven’t lived. You are always the one at the table asking the waiter where the chicken is from and whether the beef is grass fed.<br></br></label

      <label
        ><input
          name="prefer"
          value="data-visualization"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />No-Waste Maven ♻️: Putting something in the trash gives you the hives. You carry a mason jar, fold up utensils, a straw, and reusable bag with you at all times. Trying to give you anything – a gift, promotional materials, a receipt or plastic straw – has you playing hot potato, refusing to touch it or handing it back. You DIY all your own beauty products and only buy used clothing and other items because they come without packaging.<br></br></label

      <label
        ><input
          name="prefer"
          value="challenges"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Non-Toxic Obsessive 🌱: You eat only organic, use all-natural beauty products, buy clothing made with organic cotton and other natural fibers, and clean your home using baking soda, vinegar, and essential oils. You also avoid eating large fish because mercury, and when you move into a new place you strip the walls and paint them with no-VOC paints. The most expensive thing you own is your mattress, which is free of flame retardants and other chemicals that usually come in mattresses.<br></br></label

      <label
        ><input
          name="prefer"
          value="open-source-community"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Conscious Entrepreneur 🌎: You’re going to save the world yourself! You’ve founded a company that addresses some nagging problem you had, selling an item you couldn’t find before in the sustainable or ethical version. You’ve given a TEDx talk (or hope to someday), love a good tradeshow, and know how to work a Kickstarter campaign.<br></br></label

          value="gitter-help-rooms"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Anti-Capitalist 🙅: You think the whole system is broken and needs to be thrown out. Corporations are evil, responsible for almost all environmental destruction. No, there is no “compromise” or “working together toward solutions.” Any environmental organization that colludes with a multi-national to marginally improve environmental standouts is a sellout and a turncoat. You’re probably a freegan, who dumpster dives for perfectly good thrown out food in protest of our wasteful society. You get all your clothing through swaps and bartering. You think Greenpeace has gone soft.<br></br></label

      <label
        ><input
          name="prefer"
          value="videos"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Vegan/Animal Rights Advocate 🐣: Forget humans, we’re the ones that messed everything up! You’re doing it for the animals, which half of – everyone seems to not have heard – are on the brink of extinction. You don’t eat meat or animal products, you don’t wear meat or animal products, and your dog is a rescue. Your charitable dollars go to rescuing lab animals, and you would “rather go naked than wear fur.” You don’t want to lecture people but … why can’t they see your side??<br></br></label

      <label
        ><input
          name="prefer"
          value="city-meetups"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Vintage and Thrift Shopper 🛍: You never buy anything new because that takes resources. You love a good swap, your favorite pastime is rummaging through the local thrift or salvage store, and your motto is, “I don’t pay retail.” You spend a lot of time browsing through Depop and eBay to find a preloved wardrobe. You have a sewing machine with which to repair clothing and you’re handy with the paint brush.<br></br></label

      <label
        ><input
          name="prefer"
          value="wiki"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Minimalist 🛀: You hardly ever buy anything, but when you do, it takes months of research to find just the perfect object, which is usually handcrafted in the UK by an artisan. Then, you get rid of something else in your home to compensate. You only have 10 outfits and five pairs of shoes.<br></br></label

      <label
        ><input
          name="prefer"
          value="forum"
          type="checkbox"
          class="input-checkbox"
        />Carbon Hater 🔋: All that other stuff is just side notes. The real problem is carbon emissions, which are heating up the Earth and freaking you out with the potential for crazier weather, climate-induced wars, and rising sea levels. Everything you do is done with an eye toward reducing your carbon emissions. You have a windmill or solar panels (or both), or you’ve signed up for wind power. You only use your bike and public transportation to get around, buy local food, and buy used (because everything that is produced emits carbon emissions).</label
